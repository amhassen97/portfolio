My name is Abdullah Hassen, born in 1997, from Pretoria, South Africa (but with a bit of Aussie heritage too).

I enjoy problem solving as well as learning new things (whether it be in my field/profession or not), and using such learnt knowledge to help me
solve problems in different and unique ways.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering as well as a post-graduate Honours degree in Industrial Engineering, however life has afforded me the amazing opportunity to work
in the world of software engineering, where my passion for problem solving is really pushed to its absolute limit.

My first full-time job introduced me into the world of RPA, automation and process optimisation, and thereafter I took the opportunity to move into a software engineering 
role, which I very much enjoy.
